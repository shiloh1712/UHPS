Josh:
    I think we should have an easily comprehendable way to show the history rather than just listing out the times and locations.
    I also think that we should make a place where you can see the status of all your packages at the same time rather than having to check each one individually
    As far as what i can contribute i havent done anything like this before so im not entirely sure. I know C++ and python and the only database i ever used was microsoft access in a 
      class I took at lonestar like 4 or 5 years ago. I think i am pretty good at coding and debugging though so i should be able to contribute a sizeable amount there

    1. Ideas:

    Entity: Packages, customers, tracking
    Attributes:
    Packages: going in and out of the post office (Time and Location), where they are going (location and name of receiver), and who is sending them (customer name)

    Customers: Name, Address, age, Special package being sent?

    Tracking: current location, past location, total progress of shipment?

    2. Contribution Preferences: 
    Iâ€™m personally willing to do anything! I love learning new languages, and am very interested in the User interface aspect of this assignment. 
    I am mostly familiar with Python, C++, and Ruby; also loving data science as a whole.

1. I looked at what ideas were presemted already and i agree with what we have so far.
Some things I could add onto what we have already is having the packages be assigned to customers, tracking times, having an order #, and maybe an order history for customers to see.
Something else to consider is returns or cancelled or lost packages.

2. I am willing to do anything as well as I do not have much experience in databases. I know c++ and python.
