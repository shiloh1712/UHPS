1. Ideas:

Entity: Packages, customers, tracking
Attributes:
Packages: going in and out of the post office (Time and Location), where they are going (location and name of receiver), and who is sending them (customer name)

Customers: Name, Address, age, Special package being sent?

Tracking: current location, past location, total progress of shipment?

2. Contribution Preferences: 
Iâ€™m personally willing to do anything! I love learning new languages, and am very interested in the User interface aspect of this assignment. 
I am mostly familiar with Python, C++, and Ruby; also loving data science as a whole.
