I think we should have an easily comprehendable way to show the history rather than just listing out the times and locations.
I also think that we should make a place where you can see the status of all your packages at the same time rather than having to check each one individually
As far as what i can contribute i havent done anything like this before so im not entirely sure. I know C++ and python and the only database i ever used was microsoft access in a 
  class I took at lonestar like 4 or 5 years ago. I think i am pretty good at coding and debugging though so i should be able to contribute a sizeable amount there
